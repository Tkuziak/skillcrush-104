				<ol>
					<li><span>1.</span><p>Don't worry if you feel lost when you start coding. It happens to everyone. It may take a while but all of a sudden, the coding will just click. Then you will be unstoppable!</p></li>
					<li><span>2.</span><p>Don't worry about new coding languages. They are just different ways to say the same thing. Once you feel comfortable coding in one language, other languages will be a breeze to learn!</p></li>
					<li><span>3.</span><p>Don't let people who use big words scare you. Most of the time, they don't actually know what they're talking about. Big technical words scare non-techies and make them think the techies know more than they do.</p></li>
